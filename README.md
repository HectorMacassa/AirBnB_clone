## AirBnB_clone

### Description
AirBNB clone is a full stack web application, a copy of the AirBnB website.

After compeletion, you will have a complete web application composed by:

	A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
	A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
	A database or files that store data (data = objects)
	An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### Using the Console

The AirBnB console can be run both interactively and non-interactively.
To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution
of the file `console.py` at the command line.

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  all  count  create  destroy  help  quit  show  update

(hbnb)
$
```

Alternatively, to use the HolbertonBnB console in interactive mode, run the
file `console.py` by itself:

```
$ ./console.py
```
